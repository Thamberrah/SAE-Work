<body>
    <main>
        Today we'll be looking at ways to layout our our HTML in a consistent manner, but first, a little history.
        <div class="sections">
            <section>
                <h2 class=heading-title>CSS 1</h2>
                In CSS 1, the only way to structure content was through using the <code>table</code> tag. While this allowed sites to be consistent, using this tag made sites slower to load.
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2 class=heading-title>CSS 2</h2>
                CSS 2 allowed the use of <code>float:left</code> and <code>float:right</code>. This allowed more flexibility in layouts, but still made designing to multiple screens challenging. Most sites  now required both a desktop and a mobile version.
                Any animations required heavy use of Javascript

            <section>
                <h2 class=heading-title>CSS 3</h2>
                This version of CSS gave us a number of tools we can use today: <code>ems</code>, media queries, grid and flex layouts, and animations
