To complete this task, you will need to use the task1.html file. *All your CSS should be in your css file, NOT the html file*.

1. Create a css file and link it to the HTML file listed above.

2. Add a style so that the background of the contents within the <main> tag are grey(you can choose the shade of grey).
3. Add an id to the <p> tag. Make it so that the font size of the p tag is at least 20px.
4. Create a class, and add it to each of the elements in the list. Make it so the font is different (your choice)
5. (Challenge) Using the same class for the items in the list, make it so that even-numbered items have a blue background, while odd-numbered items have a white background
6. (Challenge) Using the same class, make it so when you hover over an item, the cursor changes to a finger.
