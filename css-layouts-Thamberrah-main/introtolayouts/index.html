        Today we'll be looking at ways to layout our our HTML in a consistent manner, but first, a little history.

        <section>
            <h2 >CSS 1</h2>
            In CSS 1, the only way to structure content was through using the <code>table</code> tag. While this allowed sites to be consistent, using this tag made sites slower to load.

        <section>
            <h2>CSS 2</h2>
            CSS 2 allowed the use of <code float:left</code> and <code>float:right</code>. This allowed more flexibility in layouts, but still made designing to multiple screens challenging. Most sites  now required both a desktop and a mobile version. Any animations required heavy use of Javascript

        <section>
            <h2 class=heading-title>CSS 3</h2>
            This version of CSS gave us a number of tools we can use today: <code>ems</code>, media queries, grid and flex layouts, and animations
